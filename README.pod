=head1 NAME

WWW::Wunderground::API - Use Weather Underground's XML or JSON interface

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Connects to the Weather Underground JSON/XML service and parses the data
into something usable. The entire response is available in Hash::AsObject form, so
any data that comes from the server is accessible. Print a Data::Dumper of ->data
to see all of the tasty data bits.

    use WWW::Wunderground::API;

    #location
    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('Fairfax, VA');

    #or zipcode
    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('22030');

    #or airport identifier
    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('KIAD');

    #using the options

    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API(
      location=>'22152',
      api_key=>'my wunderground api key',
      auto_api=>1,
      cache=>Cache::FileCache->new({ namespace=>'wundercache', default_expires_in=>2400 }) #A cache is probably a good idea. 
    );

    
    #Check the wunderground docs for details, but here are just a few examples 
    print 'The temperature is: '.$wun->conditions->temp_f."\n"; 
    print 'The rest of the world calls that: '.$wun->conditions->temp_c."\n"; 
    print 'Record high temperature year: '.$wun->almanac->temp_high->recordyear."\n";
    print "Sunrise at:".$wun->astronomy->sunrise->hour.':'.$wun->astronomy->sunrise->minute."\n";
    print "Simple forecast:".$wun->forecast->simpleforecast->forecastday->[0]{conditions}."\n";
    print "Text forecast:".$wun->forecast->txt_forecast->forecastday->[0]{fcttext}."\n";
    print "Long range forecast:".$wun->forecast10day->txt_forecast->forecastday->[9]{fcttext}."\n";
    print "Chance of rain three hours from now:".$wun->hourly->[3]{pop}."%\n";
    print "Nearest airport:".$wun->geolookup->nearby_weather_stations->airport->{station}[0]{icao}."\n";


=head2 update()

Included for backward compatibility only.
Refetches conditions data from the server. It will be removed in a future release.
If you specify an api_key then this is equvilent of ->api_call('conditions')

=head2 location()

Change the location. For example:

    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('22030');
    my $ffx_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

    $wun->location('KJFK');
    my $ny_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

    $wun->location('San Diego, CA');
    my $socal_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

=head_2 auto_api

set auto_api to something truthy to have the module automatically make API calls without the use of api_call()

=head_2 api_call( api_name, location )

set api_name to any location-based wunderground api call (eg almanac,conditions,forecast,history...)
set location to any valid location (eg 22152,'KIAD','q/CA/SanFrancisco',...)


=head2 raw()

Returns raw text result from the most recent API call. This will be either xml or json depending on api_type

=head2 xml()

*Deprecated* - use raw() instead
Returns raw xml result from wunderground server where applicable

*Deprecated* - use raw() instead
=head2 json()

Returns raw json result from wunderground server where applicable

=head2 data()

Contains all weather data from server parsed into convenient Hash::AsObject form;

=head2 api_key()

Required for JSON api access.

=head2 api_type()

Defaults to xml. If an api_key is specified, this will be set to json.
