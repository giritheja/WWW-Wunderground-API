=head1 NAME

WWW::Wunderground::API - Use Weather Underground's XML or JSON interface

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Connects to the Weather Underground JSON/XML service and parses the data
into something usable. The entire response is available in Hash::AsObject form, so
any data that comes from the server is accessible. Print a Data::Dumper of ->data
to see all of the tasty data bits.

    use WWW::Wunderground::API;

    #location
    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('Fairfax, VA');

    #or zipcode
    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('22030');

    #or airport identifier
    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('KIAD');

    #using the json API.
    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API(location=>'KIAD', api_key=>'your wunderground API key');

    print 'The temperature is: '.$wun->data->temp_f."\n";
    print 'The rest of the world calls that: '.$wun->temp_c."\n"; #Keys are AUTOLOADed to $wun->data->$key for lazy typers.
    print 'XML source:'.$wun->xml if $wun->api_type eq 'xml';
    print 'JSON source:'.$wun->json if $wun->api_type eq 'json';


=head2 update()

Refetch data from the server. This is called automatically every time location is set, but you may want to put it in a timer.

=head2 location()

Change the location. For example:

    my $wun = new WWW::Wunderground::API('22030');
    my $ffx_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

    $wun->location('KJFK');
    my $ny_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

    $wun->location('San Diego, CA');
    my $socal_temp = $wun->data->temp_f;

=head2 xml()

Returns raw xml result from wunderground server where applicable

=head2 json()

Returns raw json result from wunderground server where applicable

=head2 data()

Contains all weather data from server parsed into convenient Hash::AsObject form;

=head2 api_key()
